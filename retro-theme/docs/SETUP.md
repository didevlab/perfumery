# Setup Guide

Step-by-step guide to install **retro-theme** and apply a bundled palette to
whatever terminal you're running — from a fresh machine to a themed prompt.

`retro-theme` detects your terminal from environment variables and themes it
through that terminal's own config. The CRT/glow screen effect is applied only
where the terminal supports it — real shaders on Ghostty (GLSL) and Windows
Terminal (HLSL `pixelShaderPath`, with the built-in retro effect as a fallback);
every other terminal gets the colors only.

`install.sh` is a **universal orchestrator**: it installs the core, then detects
your OS/terminal and sets up the best CRT mechanism for you — Ghostty GLSL,
Windows Terminal HLSL, a Linux **compositor** (`effects/compositor`, CRT on any
terminal), or **cool-retro-term** (`effects/cool-retro-term`, a dedicated CRT
terminal). See [Screen Effects (CRT / Glow)](#5-screen-effects-crt--glow).

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [ ] `bash` available (the engine is a Bash 5 script)
- [ ] The terminal you want to theme — and you are **running inside it**
      (detection reads that terminal's environment variables)
- [ ] `curl` — only needed for the remote one-liner install
- [ ] `jq` — only needed if you will theme **Windows Terminal**
- [ ] `~/.local/bin` on your `PATH` (the installer warns you if it isn't)

### Verify Dependencies

```bash
bash --version
# Expected: GNU bash, version 5.x ...

command -v jq && jq --version
# Expected (only required for Windows Terminal): jq-1.6  (or similar)
```

---

## 2. Install

The installer drops the command, palettes, shaders and the `rt` alias into your
home directory, then orchestrates a CRT effect for your OS/terminal. It is
idempotent and backs up an existing Ghostty config.

### Option A — Remote one-liner

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/didevlab/perfumery/main/retro-theme/install.sh | bash

# …or force the CRT mechanism (default is auto-detect):
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/didevlab/perfumery/main/retro-theme/install.sh | bash -s -- --effect compositor
```

### Option B — From a checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/didevlab/perfumery.git
cd perfumery/retro-theme
./install.sh
./install.sh --effect cool-retro-term   # or: --no-effect
```

### Effect selection

The installer's CRT step is controlled by one flag (also available as the
`RT_EFFECT` env var):

| Value | Effect step |
|-------|-------------|
| `--effect auto` *(default)* | Detect the OS/terminal and pick the best mechanism (asks before touching a compositor) |
| `--effect compositor` | Force the Linux compositor CRT — [`effects/compositor`](../effects/compositor/README.md) |
| `--effect cool-retro-term` | Force the dedicated CRT terminal — [`effects/cool-retro-term`](../effects/cool-retro-term/README.md) |
| `--effect none` / `--no-effect` | Skip the effect step entirely |

### What gets installed

| Target | Path |
|--------|------|
| `retro-theme` command | `~/.local/bin/retro-theme` |
| Bundled themes (24) | `~/.config/retro-theme/themes/*.conf` |
| Shaders (GLSL + HLSL) | `~/.config/ghostty/shaders/{crt,glow}.glsl` and `{crt,glow}.hlsl` |
| Ghostty config (only if Ghostty is installed) | `~/.config/ghostty/config` |
| `rt` alias + zsh completion | appended to `~/.zshrc` |
| CRT effect (chosen by detection / `--effect`) | via a sub-recipe under `effects/` — e.g. compositor config or cool-retro-term |

### Verify the install

```bash
source ~/.zshrc        # load the rt alias + completion
retro-theme -l
# Expected: a list of 24 themes, e.g.
#   Retro Green        [retro]
#   Amber CRT          [retro]
#   Dracula            [futuristic]
#   ...
```

If you see `retro-theme: command not found`, add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

---

## 3. Detect Your Terminal

`retro-theme` recognizes your terminal from the environment variables it exports.

```bash
retro-theme --detect
# Expected (example, depends on where you run it):
#   Detected: ghostty
# or:
#   Detected: windows-terminal
# or, if nothing matched:
#   Detected: none
```

Detection map (the script checks these variables):

| Terminal | Detected when |
|----------|---------------|
| Ghostty | `TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` or `TERM=xterm-ghostty` |
| Windows Terminal | `WT_SESSION` is set, **or** running under WSL (`microsoft`/`wsl` in `/proc/version`) |
| GNOME Terminal | `GNOME_TERMINAL_SCREEN` is set |
| Terminator | `TERMINATOR_UUID` is set |
| kitty | `KITTY_WINDOW_ID` set or `TERM=xterm-kitty` |
| Alacritty | `ALACRITTY_WINDOW_ID`/`ALACRITTY_SOCKET` set or `TERM=alacritty` |
| WezTerm | `WEZTERM_PANE` set or `TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm` |
| iTerm2 | `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` |

> If you get `Detected: none`, you can still theme everything with `--all`
> (see step 4) — detection is just a convenience.

---

## 4. Apply a Theme

Apply to the **detected** terminal:

```bash
retro-theme "Tokyo Night"      # by display name
retro-theme tokyo-night        # …or by slug (the .conf filename)
```

Expected output (example for Ghostty):

```
==> Applying 'Tokyo Night' to: ghostty
==> Ghostty: colors written to ~/.config/ghostty/config (reload: Ctrl+Shift+,)
```

Apply to **every** supported terminal found on the machine:

```bash
retro-theme dracula --all
# Expected:
#   ==> Applying 'Dracula' to: ghostty windows-terminal gnome-terminal ...
#   (one ==> line per terminal that is present; others are skipped with [!])
```

Reload the terminal so it picks up the new colors:

| Terminal | Reload |
|----------|--------|
| Ghostty | `Ctrl+Shift+,` |
| kitty | `Ctrl+Shift+F5` |
| GNOME Terminal / Terminator | open a new window |
| Windows Terminal / Alacritty / WezTerm / iTerm2 | new window or auto-reload |

## 5. Screen Effects (CRT / Glow)

There are two layers here:

1. **The orchestrator** (`install.sh`) picks a CRT *mechanism* for your machine.
2. **`retro-theme fx`** toggles the effect on the shader-capable terminals
   (Ghostty / Windows Terminal).

### 5.1 The mechanism the installer chose

During install the orchestrator detects your OS/terminal and wires up one of:

| Environment | CRT mechanism | How to use it |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| WSL | Windows Terminal HLSL shader | `rt fx crt` (already wired) |
| Ghostty installed | GLSL shader | `rt fx crt` |
| Linux desktop, no Ghostty | compositor — picom (X11) / Hyprland (Wayland), CRT on **any** terminal | set up by [`effects/compositor`](../effects/compositor/README.md) during install |
| Fallback (incl. macOS without Ghostty) | cool-retro-term — dedicated CRT terminal | launch `cool-retro-term` ([`effects/cool-retro-term`](../effects/cool-retro-term/README.md)) |

In `--effect auto` (the default) the compositor path is **interactive**: the
installer asks before changing your compositor config. A non-interactive run
(piped from `wget`) prints the command instead. Force a path any time with
`--effect compositor` or `--effect cool-retro-term`, or run the sub-recipe's own
`install.sh` directly (each has its own `README.md` and `docs/`).

### 5.2 Toggling the effect (`retro-theme fx`)

On Ghostty and Windows Terminal, the effect is separate from the palette and you
toggle it with:

```bash
retro-theme fx crt     # CRT scanlines + curvature
retro-theme fx glow    # neon bloom
retro-theme fx off     # remove the effect
```

- **Ghostty** — `crt` and `glow` switch the `custom-shader` line in
  `~/.config/ghostty/config` (pointing at `crt.glsl` / `glow.glsl`). Reload with
  `Ctrl+Shift+,`.
- **Windows Terminal** — `crt` and `glow` both work. `fx` copies the matching
  `crt.hlsl` / `glow.hlsl` into the Windows Terminal `LocalState` folder and sets
  `profiles.defaults.experimental.pixelShaderPath` (converted to a Windows path
  with `wslpath -w`). If the `.hlsl` file or `wslpath` isn't available, `crt`
  falls back to the built-in `retroTerminalEffect`. `fx off` removes the shader.
  Reopen the tab to see it.
- **All other terminals** — `retro-theme fx` has no shader to toggle; you'll see
  `screen effects not supported (colors only)`. For a CRT on these terminals use
  the [compositor](../effects/compositor/README.md) recipe (Linux) or
  [cool-retro-term](../effects/cool-retro-term/README.md).

Expected output:

```
==> Ghostty: effect=crt (reload: Ctrl+Shift+,)
==> Windows Terminal: effect=glow (reopen the tab)
```

Each theme also has a **default effect** (its `fx=` field): `retro-green` and
`amber` default to `crt`; most futuristic themes (e.g. `dracula`, `nord`,
`tokyo-night`, `cyberpunk-neon`) default to `glow`; the rest default to `off`.
Applying a theme uses that default unless you set one explicitly with `fx`.

---

## 6. Running on WSL / Windows Terminal

This is the primary WSL use case: you run a Linux distro **inside Windows
Terminal**, and `retro-theme` patches the Windows-side `settings.json` from
inside the distro.

### 6.1 Install `jq` in the distro

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y jq
jq --version
# Expected: jq-1.6  (or similar)
```

### 6.2 Confirm Windows Terminal is detected

Run this **in a Windows Terminal tab** (not a bare WSL console window):

```bash
retro-theme --detect
# Expected: Detected: windows-terminal
```

> Any WSL session is treated as Windows Terminal (the tool detects `WT_SESSION`
> or `microsoft`/`wsl` in `/proc/version`), so detection works even from a bare
> `wsl.exe` console. The Windows-side `settings.json` still has to exist under
> `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/...` for the patch to land.

### 6.3 Apply a theme

```bash
retro-theme "Amber CRT"
# Expected:
#   ==> Applying 'Amber CRT' to: windows-terminal
#   ==> Windows Terminal: scheme 'Amber CRT' + crt HLSL shader applied
```

What this does under the hood:

- Locates `settings.json` under
  `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminal*/LocalState/settings.json`
  (or the unpackaged path under `.../Microsoft/Windows Terminal/settings.json`).
- Uses `jq` to add/replace a color **scheme** named after the theme and set it as
  the default profile's `colorScheme`.
- For a `crt`/`glow` effect, copies `crt.hlsl` / `glow.hlsl` into the Windows
  Terminal `LocalState` folder (as `retro-shader.hlsl`) and sets
  `profiles.defaults.experimental.pixelShaderPath` to its Windows path
  (`wslpath -w`). This gives the **same rich CRT/glow look as Ghostty**
  (curvature, scanlines, vignette, bloom). If the `.hlsl` or `wslpath` isn't
  available, `crt` falls back to the built-in `experimental.retroTerminalEffect`
  (then the line reads `... applied (retro effect: true)`).

Because `Amber CRT` and `Retro Green` default to `crt`, they switch on the CRT
look automatically. To force an effect on/off for the current theme:

```bash
retro-theme fx crt && retro-theme "Amber CRT"   # CRT on
retro-theme fx glow && retro-theme dracula      # neon glow on
retro-theme fx off && retro-theme "Amber CRT"   # effect off
```

### 6.4 Set the default Windows Terminal profile

Make Windows Terminal open into your WSL distro by default:

```bash
retro-theme --set-default
# Expected:
#   ==> Windows Terminal: default profile set to '<distro>' (<guid>). Reopen Windows Terminal.
```

With no argument it targets the current distro (`$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`), falling back
to the first WSL-sourced profile. Pass a name to pick a specific profile (matched
case-insensitively against the profile name):

```bash
retro-theme --set-default "Ubuntu"
```

### Verify

Open a new Windows Terminal tab — the colors and (for `crt`/`glow`) the screen
effect should be live.

---

## 7. Verify It Works

```bash
# 1. The command resolves and lists themes
retro-theme -l
# Expected: 24 themes with their [group]

# 2. Your terminal is recognized
retro-theme --detect
# Expected: Detected: <your terminal>   (not "none")

# 3. A theme applies cleanly
retro-theme nord
# Expected: ==> Applying 'Nord' to: <your terminal>  + a per-terminal ==> line
```

After reloading the terminal, the background, foreground and 16 ANSI colors
should match the chosen palette.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Problem**: `retro-theme --detect` says `Detected: none`.
**Solution**: Your terminal doesn't export a recognized variable, or `tmux`/`ssh`
stripped it. Apply to all terminals instead: `retro-theme <name> --all`.

**Problem**: `retro-theme: command not found`.
**Solution**: `~/.local/bin` isn't on `PATH`. Run
`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` and add it to your shell rc, then reload.

**Problem**: Windows Terminal: `jq required` or `settings.json not found under /mnt/c`.
**Solution**: Install `jq` in the distro (`sudo apt install jq`) and make sure
Windows Terminal is installed for your Windows user so a `settings.json` exists
under `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/AppData/...`. Run from a Windows Terminal tab.

**Problem**: `themes dir not found (set RETRO_THEME_HOME)`.
**Solution**: The themes weren't installed. Re-run `install.sh`, or point the
script at a checkout: `export RETRO_THEME_HOME=/path/to/perfumery/retro-theme/themes`.

**Problem**: Colors applied but nothing changed on screen.
**Solution**: You didn't reload. Ghostty: `Ctrl+Shift+,`; kitty: `Ctrl+Shift+F5`;
GNOME Terminal / Terminator: open a new window.

**Problem**: `Terminator: no ~/.config/terminator/config, skipping`.
**Solution**: Terminator only gets patched if it already has a config. Launch
Terminator once (or create the file) so a `[[default]]` profile exists, then
re-apply.

**Problem**: `fx glow` did nothing on a non-Ghostty / non-WT terminal.
**Solution**: Screen effects only exist on Ghostty (GLSL) and Windows Terminal
(HLSL). Every other terminal gets the colors only.

**Problem**: Windows Terminal shows no CRT/glow even though `fx` ran.
**Solution**: The HLSL shader needs `wslpath` and the bundled `.hlsl` files
(`~/.config/ghostty/shaders/{crt,glow}.hlsl`). Without them, `crt` falls back to
the built-in `retroTerminalEffect` and `glow` does nothing. Re-run `install.sh`
to restore the shaders, then `retro-theme fx crt|glow` and reopen the tab.
